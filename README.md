# Best-First-Algorithm
In BFS and DFS, when we are at a node, we can consider any of the adjacent as the next
node. So both BFS and DFS blindly explore paths without considering any cost function. The
idea of Best First Search is to use an evaluation function to decide which adjacent is most
promising and then explore.
